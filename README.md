# An-ANN-based-Model-for-Learning-Individual-Customer-Behavior-in-Response-to-Electricity-Prices:
Two new methods are
presented for predicting the hourly loads using the outdoor
temperatures, electricity prices and previous loads. The
proposed models are based respectively on a fully connected
neural network and a Long-Short-term memory network.
Both models deal with the uncertainty of household devices
and its indoor temperature. Numerical results show the
high performance of the proposed methods in terms of
accuracy of the predictions. Both models can learn the
consumption patterns and are able to give a good
approximation of the load profile given a set of prices and
temperatures. The proposed architecture can be used to
investigate the price elasticity of demand, which can be used
in several applications such as optimal pricing, demand
flexibility or carbon emission reduction.
